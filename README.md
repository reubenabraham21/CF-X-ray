# CF-X-ray
Computer Applications for BME project aiming to analyze the progression of Cystic Fribrosis using chest X-ray images.

## About the project
This project is designed to analyze chest X-ray images of patients with and without cystic fibrosis.

Cystic fibrosis is a progressive and genetic disease that creates a gene mutation and causes mucus, sweat, and digestive juice to be sticky and thick [^1]. These fluids end up clogging ducts in the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems, causing serious consequences to the patient. This disease is diagnosed with a blood, sweat, genetic test, and X-ray, or a combination of these [^2].

Cystic fibrosis can be identified in X-ray images as discoloration that stands out from the traditional color of lungs. Therefore, this project creates a Matlab code that analyzes these images and quantify the area percentage affected by the lesion. Doctors are then able to quicly obtain results about the patient, which can be connected directly to the patient’s health records, allowing health practitioners to have immediate information. 

## About the data
The data source used for this project is [Medscape](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/354931-overview?form=fpf), which has a collection of 17 high-quality X-ray images of lungs with cystic fibrosis. As described below, the images should be saved and uploaded to Matlab so that they can be analyzed by the code. It is also important that the pictures are frontal views of the patient so that the parametrization can be properly done. 

## Running the code
1. Open in MATLAB Online to run the example in your web browser with no installation required.
2. Download the _CF_ImageAnalysis_ code demo and the _X-ray images_.
3. Upload all files from previous step to Matlab.
4. Input the name of the image you want to analyze.
5. Check the percentage of lung area affected by mucus to note down the disease's progression!

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The code and image files should be in the same folder in Matlab as the code you are running.
