# CF-X-ray
Comp apps project for analyzing Cystic Fribrosis progression using chest X-ray images.

## About the project

## About the data
The data source used for this project is Medscape, which has a collection of 17 hih-quality x-ray images of lungs with cystic fibrosis. As described below, the images should be saved and uploaded to Matlab so that they can be analyzed by the code. It is also important that the pictures are frontal views of the patient so that the parametrization can be properly done. Another set of data contains healthy chest x-ray images.  

## Running the code
1. Open in MATLAB Online to run the example in your web browser with no installation required.
2. Download the project code, the cf detection function, and the x-ray images.
3. Upload all files from previous step to Matlab.
4. 

Requires:

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The function and image files should be in the same folder in Matlab as the code you are running.
